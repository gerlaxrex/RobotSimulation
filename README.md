# RobotSimulation
Little simulation for Obstacle Avoidance algorithm for a simple mobile robot. The P5.js framework has been used in order to develop this little project. This will be modified very soon in order to make the algorithm better and reproduce more real-like results (also for the representation of sensors detections).

## Settings 
Inside the simulation various settings have been put in order to control the state of the simulation:<br>
- **PositionX**: the position of the robot in the horizontal direction.<br>
- **PositionY**: the position of the robot in the vertical direction (top to bottom!!!).<br>
- **Angle**: The initial angle of the robot in degrees (0Â° points from the top to bottom).<br>
- **___Sensor**: It regulates the treshold of the distance sensor.<br>
- **OA Type**: It simply selects the type of Obstacle Avoidance algorithm we want to simulate, the static one or the dynamic one.<br>

## How to run?
Simply open the `index.html` file with your browser :)

## What to add?
- Add a functionality in order to add obstacles runtime
- Add moving obstacles
- Add camera sensor
