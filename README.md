# RobotSimulation
Little simulation for Obstacle Avoidance algorithm for a simple mobile robot. The P5.js framework has been used in order to develop this little project. This will be modified very soon in order to make the algorithm better and reproduce more real-like results (also for the representation of sensors detections).
